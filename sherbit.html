                            <p>Sherbit’s founders are the Robin Hoods in our data mining world. In today's data mining world, Sherbit envisions users empowered with their own data and understanding their behaviorial patterns. How does location affect my spending? What type of weather encourages the most exercise? or the best sleep?</p>

                            <div class="row">
                                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/sherbit/context/sherbit_screens.jpg" alt"">

                            </div>

                            <p>However, even with powerful capabilities, Sherbit still needs to clarify how users will interact with the app and what data is most relevant.  Were there enough userful takeaways? And, were the findings clear and actionable enough to use everyday?</p>

                            <p>Our team of three UX designers were excited to tackle this project.</p>

                            <p>To help answer the Sherbit team's questions, we kicked off a big research effort which included literature reviews, competitive analyses, user interviews and usability tests.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Literature Reviews</h3>
                            <p>Coming fresh into the world of personal data tracking, our team found many rich insights from academic journals, articles, blogs and the <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/424390/the-measured-life/">Quantified Self movement.</a></p>

                            <p>From our analysis, we realized that Sherbit is in the wild west of personal data tracking. No app is leading in this arena.</p>

                            <img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/sherbit/research/competitiveanalysis.png" alt"">
                            <p class="caption caption-break"></p>

                            <p>Along with a few apps we found, we compared a list of the top 50 most downloaded apps related to personal data tracking and saw:</p>

                            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                            <p>The user interviews were the juiciest part of our research process. For an app with such heavy personalization, gathering user insights was worth our due diligence.</p>

                            <p>Our team distributed an online survey to local universities and social platforms, like Reddit, Craigslist and Facebook. Gathering over 70 responses, we mapped out respondents according to how actively they engage in social apps, data tracking and goals setting. </p>

                            <p>We targeted users from each persona group to test our hypotheses, to learn how each persona group tracked goals and to see how they interacted with Sherbit's current structure. Our interview broke down into three parts: behavioral questions, a card sort and a usability test. Over a week, we interviewed over a dozen people, gathering a lot of insight. </p>

                            <blockquote>"I would love to track something like chronic pain and discover what's causing it. It could be so many things, and tracking could help me see through the noise."</blockquote>

                            <p>Recording interesting observations onto sticky notes, we arranged behavioral insights into an affinity map and usabilty notes onto printouts of current screens.  </p>

                            <p>The first two have more uses cases and motives to use Sherbit, and they are most likely to be first adopters. The latter two personas will use Sherbit out of curiosity and will use as Sherbit gains more traction.</p>

                            <p>Based on the needs we heard from users, we established three guiding principles to anchor our ideation process:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Be readable at a glance.</li>
                                <li>Be customizable for people's different methods of organization.</li>
                                <li>Be as actionable as a to do list.</li>

                            <p>Now that we had gathered insights and defined our personas, we needed to distill the common and varient needs we were solving for. Referencing our journey maps and use cases, our team listed out each persona's needs, desire and painpoint.</p>

                            <p>These notes were then condensed into nine common painpoints emerging across the persona groups. Now, our job was to sketch out ideas that help each persona address these painpoints.</p>
                            

                            <h3>Brainstorm</h3>
                            <p>We sketched out ideas on our own before sharing them with the group. Our pitches described which painpoint and persona we were solving for. These, again, were organized into a chart according to which painpoint and persona the idea solved for.</p>

                            <p>We voted on the top three solutions to explore further. When selecting ideas, I wanted to avoid band-aid fixes, focus on innovation and address the pressing faults within the app.</p>

                            <p>Pressed for time, each team member spearheaded one recommendation to develop into a wireframe. We would present and reiterate on our ideas as a group. Also, we created a recommendations document with a handful of promising ideas and sketches that didn't make the cut.</p>

                            <p>In the end, these were our three recommendations developed into wireframe form. While still in low-fidelity, they addressed user painpoints and communicated solutions to our client's challenges.</p>

                            <h5>#1: Onboarding Process</h5>

                            <p>Our team decided that the onboarding was critical to lessen the learning curve. Users needed a basic overview and, most of all, a little hand holding. Our on-boarding process briefly describes the product benefits, walks users through making their first recipe and drops users off at the dashboard, the main screen of interaction.</p>

                            <h5>#2: Dashboard of Insights</h5>

                            <p>Changing the dashboard was our biggest move. We needed a way to help users get the insights quickly as they check the app throughout the day or week.</p>

                            <p>Now, the dashboard is insight-driven. Users can design their dashboard with relevant, insight-focused data. If they are curious for more information, they can swipe further for detailed graphs and then again click into graphs for more information.</p>

                            <p>Our clients loved it. They even called us three times after our presentation with kind words for our final deliverable. </p>

                            <p>Working on Sherbit has been an incredibly gratifying project. It was an honor to work with such a talented and ambitious client. Moreover, a researcher at heart, I enjoyed unearthing insights from talking and observing users.Within a short three week timeframe, we were able to give recommendations that address honest user needs and offer delightful experiences.</p>

                            <p>Sherbit was a big growing experience for me. If our team was to continue working on Sherbit, I would like to explore more of the ideas we brainstormed, take our product to a higher fidelity and perform much more user testing. I'd like to bring our prototype to each persona group to test our prototype.</p>

                            <p>All in all, I appreciated our client's investment in our research and our team's creativity and tenacity to deliver user centered recommendations.</p>
